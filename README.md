Summary
As a Campus Ambassador at MyGov India, I promote and facilitate the participation of students and faculty in
various initiatives and activities of the government of India. I also collaborate with other campus ambassadors
across the country to share ideas, feedback, and best practices. I am proud to be part of this program that aims to
empower and engage the youth in nation-building and social welfare.
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Engineering at Savitribai Phule Pune
University and Sinhgad Institute of Technology. I have a keen interest in programming and technology, and I
have learned various skills such as C++, C, and Generative AI. I have also participated in multiple programs,
workshops, and courses to enhance my knowledge and skills, such as the GitHub Student Developer Program,
the Campus Mantri Program at GeeksforGeeks, and the IEEE Bombay Section and Techfest IITB Membership.
I am motivated by my curiosity and passion for technology, and I aspire to become a proficient and innovative
programmer in the future.
